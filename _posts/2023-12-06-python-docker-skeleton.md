It's just a skeleton for creating python projects using docker and poetry for dependency management. Now I don't have to this everytime I start something. It's not perfect, but it works. Getting rid of the barriers is the best way to make progress.

* Staged Docker build??
* pre-commit hooks, e.g., flakehave, black, isort or perhaps ruff
