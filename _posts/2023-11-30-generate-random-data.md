It's helpful to generate random data in the shape of the vendor models when integrating with third parties.

Here's the first step in building a service that generate random data in the shape of specific model.
## Model Generation
There's a tool that can take an [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) spec and generate a [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) model. It's called datamodel-code-generator and you can read about it [here](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator). A URL that points to an API spec can be passed and the output is a Python module containing the Pydantic models.

The Pydantic models are output. Many options available to control behavior, here's a simple example from this [spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/main/examples/v3.1/webhook-example.yaml)

The input file type was determined to be: openapi
This can be specificied explicitly with the `--input-file-type` option.

from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Optional

from pydantic import BaseModel


class Pet(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    tag: Optional[str] = None
{% endhighlight %}
## Randomess
Polyfactoy (used to be Pydantic factories) can create instances of Pydantic models, assigning random data to the fields. It's fairly configurable too. Here's an (messy) example usind the model above
{% highlight python %}
In [12]: class Pet(BaseModel):
    ...:     id: int
    ...:     name: str
    ...:     tag: Optional[str] = None

In [13]: from polyfactory.factories.pydantic_factory import ModelFactory

In [14]: class PetFactory(ModelFactory):
    ...:     __model__ = Pet
    ...:

In [15]: pet = PetFactory.build()

In [16]: print(pet)
id=7612 name='yqdjJbkFbaRUjuGSrQmD' tag='qdjsdoEIOrmVeNaffMHy'
{% endhighlight %}
## Service
Putting those two things together gives you a service that can generate random data in the shape of a model provided by an OpenAPI spec. It works, but it's a work in progress. Here's the [code](https://github.com/unlisted/random_api).
### Some Code Highlights
The model can be [persisted](https://github.com/unlisted/random_api/blob/90fc0af6f8f87c22cdae82dcb91dbd182925a2b4/app/importer.py#L50) for future use.  
The model is [written](https://github.com/unlisted/random_api/blob/90fc0af6f8f87c22cdae82dcb91dbd182925a2b4/app/importer.py#L41C7-L41C7) to temporary file, and then imported using a custom [finder](https://github.com/unlisted/random_api/blob/90fc0af6f8f87c22cdae82dcb91dbd182925a2b4/app/importer.py#L140).
